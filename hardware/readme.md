# Manufacturing
## Gerber data
To make a PCB you need to download the zipped gerber files (Main_gerger.zip and LR_gerber.zip) and upload them to a PCB manufacturer like AllPCB.  

"Main_gerber.zip" is a gerber data of the main PCB.  
"LR_gerber.zip" is a gerber data for the L button and R button.  

## Ordering options
When you order the PCB, it is better to select "gold-plating" option so that conduction between pads of the PCB and rubber buttons of SFC controller keep well.  

## BOM
You need to buy the parts listed in the BOM.  
In addition, you also need to buy following:

- Wires connecting between Main PCB and L/R PCB.
- USB cable that will be stripped and soldered to the Main PCB.
